# FlatlineOps

**What**: ArgoCD Configuration repository. It will utilize the a **App-of-Apps** for bootstrapping and cluster separation, and ApplicationSet with **Merge generator** for deploying apps with per-env Helm values.

**Purpose**: for my home-lab kubernetes clusters.
Just playing and deving around.

**Repo Name**: Tribute to Dixie Flatline, the dead cowboy whose construct lives on. A console cowboy who operates with ghostlike precision ðŸ‘»
